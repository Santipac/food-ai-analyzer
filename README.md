# Overview

Create an app that, given a plate of food, returns an output that you choose: macros, calories, personalized tips based on the user's information, and anything else you think is relevant.

- The app could be web, mobile or even an API, whatever you feel the most comfortable with.
- The input could be text/photo/audio.
- You can structure the output schema however you want.

## Test Criteria

- [ ] Document your journey while you solve the challenge. You can include decisions, tradeoffs and everything you consider that could help us understanding your process. It can be in the form of a README, a changelog, a presentation, or a simple brain-dump in a text file. It can also be a combination of those.
- [ ] As you can see, the description doesn't get into the details of how to make the app. This is by design. The idea is that you choose how to approach it based on your strengths and how to provide the most value to the target user in the limited time that you have to develop it.
- [ ] Treat the project as a production-ready one.
- [ ] We expect you to spend ~4 hours on the challenge. Given the time constraint, you'll need to take some shortcuts, either in performance, edge cases, scalability, etc. Please list them in the document.
- [ ] The ~4 hours you spend on the challenge don't need to be all at once, you can split them into multiple sessions.
- [ ] Make sure to let us know how many hours did you end up investing and how did you split them.
- [ ] Use TypeScript.
- [ ] The goal is to provide value to health-conscious users who want to track macros and understand more about what they're eating. Add features relevant to this target audience.
